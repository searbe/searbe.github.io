For some reason I thought it'd be fun to write a succinct static website generator.

It's not as succinct as I expected. To build the site, run:

    go get cmd
    go run cmd/*

Serve locally with

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then commit the changes and push to your Github pages, like this repo.
